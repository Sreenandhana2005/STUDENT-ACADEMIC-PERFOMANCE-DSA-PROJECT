🎓 Student Dropout Prediction Using Academic Performance

This project aims to predict whether a student will drop out or successfully graduate based on academic performance and multiple related features. By analyzing historical student data, the system identifies patterns that contribute to student success or risk of dropout.

The project uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning techniques to build predictive models. Key features include academic scores, attendance, and other performance-related factors that influence student outcomes. The model classifies students into two categories: Dropout or Graduate.
